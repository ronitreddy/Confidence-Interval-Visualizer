### Confidence Interval Visualizer (Means)

**What the App Does:**  
This app provides an interactive way to understand and visualize confidence intervals for means. Users can select between the Normal Distribution and t-Distribution, input sample size (n), sample mean (x̄), and standard deviation (sample: s, population: σ), and choose a confidence level to generate a graphical representation of the confidence interval around the sample mean.

**Why the App is Useful:**  
Understanding confidence intervals is crucial in statistics for estimating the range within which the true population parameter lies with a certain level of confidence. This app demystifies the concept by providing a hands-on, visual learning tool that can be especially beneficial for students, educators, and professionals in statistics.

**Getting Started:**  
- Choose the distribution type based on your data characteristics.
- Enter the sample size, sample mean, and standard deviation.
- Adjust the confidence level slider to see how it affects the confidence interval.
- Observe the dynamically generated plot and confidence interval description below it.
